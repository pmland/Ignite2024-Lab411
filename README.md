# Welcome to LAB411

In this lab, you’ll work through four hands-on exercises designed to build your skills with Azure and intelligent app development. Below is an overview of each exercise:

1. [**Exercise 1**](./LabInstructions/Exercise-1.md) - Get started with intelligent app development by learning to use the [Azure OpenAI SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.openai-readme?view=azure-dotnet) to call the [Chat Completions API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.openai-readme?view=azure-dotnet#chat-completion), leveraging the GPT-4 model and deploy to Azure App Service.
  
2. [**Exercise 2**](./LabInstructions/Exercise-2.md) - Learn how to integrate the [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/quick-start-guide?pivots=programming-language-csharp) into your application to interact seamlessly with Azure OpenAI services and deploy to Azure App Service.
  
3. [**Exercise 3**](./LabInstructions/Exercise-3.md) - Explore the sidecar extensibility feature in Azure App Service. You’ll add an OpenTelemetry (OTEL) sidecar to the app deployed in Exercise 1 for enhanced observability.
  
4. [**Exercise 4**](./LabInstructions/Exercise-4.md) - Discover the power and advantages of Small Language Models (SLMs) by building an intelligent app with Phi3 as a sidecar.

To get started, fork this repository to your GitHub account. Detailed instructions for each exercise are available in the `LabInstructions` folder.

Happy learning!
